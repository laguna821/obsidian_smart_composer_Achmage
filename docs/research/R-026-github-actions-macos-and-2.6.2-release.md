# R-026: GitHub Actions macOS Qualification And 2.6.2 Release

## Status

- Evidence status: **Partially verified**
- Planning use: **Mandatory for the 2.6.2 release**
- Investigation date: 2026-08-10
- Repository baseline: tag `2.6.1` at
  `bb6f24821c5e4e8c567b0600598b2b66437511ae`; release work occurs only on
  `codex/2.6.2-native-plan-onboarding`
- Target release: `2.6.2`

## Executive Summary

GitHub Actions can supply clean Apple Silicon and Intel macOS virtual machines
for source tests, official installer smoke tests, and a pinned Obsidian desktop
smoke without putting a personal account or credential into CI. It cannot
verify human paste behavior, browser OAuth, Apple Keychain persistence, or
personal-plan billing provenance. Those boundaries must not be described as
tested.

The repository's original CI and release workflows were not reusable for this
release: CI listened only to `release/**` pushes and PRs into `main`, while the
release workflow was hard-coded to tag `2.6.1`, the 2.6.1 branch, and the 2.6.1
notes. The 2.6.2 workflow contract is a new `codex/**`/all-PR CI, two current
macOS runner architectures, reviewed installer-byte allowlists, a secret-free
Obsidian CLI fixture smoke, and a tag workflow that creates a draft, verifies
downloaded assets, and only then publishes.

The first remote branch run reached all four source-test platforms. Windows,
Apple Silicon macOS, and Intel macOS passed; Ubuntu exposed a host-dependent
test fixture that treated its unsupported host OS as the selected Windows tab.
The product correctly refused to run that other-platform action, so the test
was corrected to declare Windows explicitly. Because the Ubuntu prerequisite
failed, official-installer and Obsidian desktop matrices did not run. A fresh
exact-SHA run and its second attempt therefore remain release gates.

The replacement run proved all four source gates and both reviewed official
installer jobs. Both Obsidian jobs then exposed two harness defects rather
than a product assertion: the CLI socket appeared before its documented
`version` command was registered, and the harness compared the CLI's actual
`=> true` result with the impossible exact string `true`. The harness now waits
for the documented command registry, waits again after restricted-mode reload,
checks plugin load completion, and parses both documented-style and raw boolean
results. No failed run is reused for release qualification.

The next exact-SHA run proved those corrections and again passed every source
and official-installer job. Its two desktop jobs exposed a third independent
harness assumption: Obsidian 1.13.4 defaults `settingsPopoutWindow` to `true`,
so `app.setting.open()` created a separate renderer while CLI `eval`, DOM
queries, and screenshots remained scoped to the main renderer. Both artifacts
showed the plugin loaded with no JavaScript errors and no settings DOM in the
main document. The disposable vault now explicitly sets the option to `false`,
proves that override loaded, opens Settings once through the registered
`app:open-settings` command, requires the CLI's exact successful execution
result, waits for the main-window modal and plugin-tab registration, and
selects the plugin tab once before asserting its terminal render state.

Run 31328304443 at `eacde293a5c79d49ead6e2ac045f8ac1124b350c`
proved that correction on both architectures. Each desktop job reached the
main-document Settings root, found both Plan cards, opened the Claude installer,
verified its Windows/macOS tabs, completed installation checking with an inert
fixture, and observed Step 4 unlock without closing the modal. The only failure
was the harness's document-global `.modal-close-button` predicate immediately
after the Claude screenshot; Gemini was never reached. Modal teardown is now
scoped from the active provider marker to its own modal container and backdrop,
then verified by waiting for that provider marker to disappear.

## Research Question

How can Smart Composer 2.6.2 obtain reproducible Windows and dual-architecture
macOS evidence and publish a release from a new branch without silently using
personal credentials, mutable unreviewed installers, a lightweight tag, stale
branch metadata, or unverified release assets?

### In scope

- Repository/default-branch, tag, release, and workflow baseline.
- GitHub-hosted Windows and macOS runner availability.
- Current official Claude Code and Antigravity installer bytes.
- Pinned Obsidian macOS release and official CLI capabilities.
- Pull-request CI and safe annotated-tag release automation.

### Out of scope

- Implementing runtime, settings, React, or release-note code.
- Logging into Claude, Google, or Obsidian in CI.
- Billable model inference or updater execution.
- Claiming a human visual/keyboard UX test from DOM assertions.
- Changing the repository default branch or merging the draft PR.

## Baseline And Reproducibility

Repository API and local Git checks on 2026-08-10 established:

- repository: `laguna821/obsidian_smart_composer_Achmage`;
- default branch: `codex/2.6.1-plan-runtime-hotfix`;
- 2.6.1/default-branch commit:
  `bb6f24821c5e4e8c567b0600598b2b66437511ae`;
- new local and remote branch: `codex/2.6.2-native-plan-onboarding`, created
  from that exact commit;
- Draft PR [#1](https://github.com/laguna821/obsidian_smart_composer_Achmage/pull/1)
  targets the unchanged 2.6.1 default branch and remains unmerged;
- `main` remains an older baseline and is not the 2.6.2 PR base;
- the 2.6.1 annotated tag resolves to the same commit;
- the published 2.6.1 release is stable and has exactly `main.js`,
  `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`, but its `targetCommitish` field is stale;
- no branch protection or ruleset currently supplies required checks.

The old workflow source was inspected at the same commit. The new workflow and
allowlist source paths are recorded below. Final qualifying-run results and
generated artifact hashes remain pending until the replacement branch SHA
passes both attempts and the tag workflow rebuilds the release assets.

Local static validation completed on 2026-08-10:

- both workflows parsed as YAML with the expected job graph;
- the first-party action release feeds were rechecked and the workflows use
  current major lines `actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-node@v7`, and
  `actions/upload-artifact@v7`;
- `actionlint` 1.7.12 reported no errors (official Windows amd64 archive,
  SHA-256 `6e7241b51e6817ea6a047693d8e6fed13b31819c9a0dd6c5a726e1592d22f6e9`);
- both macOS shell scripts passed `bash -n`;
- the artifact verifier passed `node --check`, accepted the exact reviewed
  Claude installer, and rejected a one-line mutation;
- Prettier accepted every changed workflow, script, JSON, and research file.

The corresponding latest first-party releases at inspection time were
`checkout` v7.0.1 (2026-07-20), `setup-node` v7.0.0 (2026-07-14), and
`upload-artifact` v7.0.1 (2026-04-10). The workflows use their maintained major
tags so compatible patch fixes remain available.

## Verified Findings

### 1. Standard public macOS runners cover both required architectures

GitHub documents `macos-15` as an arm64 M1 runner and
`macos-15-intel` as Intel. Official GitHub actions support arm64. These runners
are clean virtual machines suitable for file, architecture, unit, build, and
non-interactive desktop smoke checks. They are not physical end-user Macs and
do not replace human observation of Terminal.app or an OAuth browser.

### 2. Mutable installer execution requires a reviewed-byte gate

Piping the latest response from a mutable URL directly into a shell would allow
the upstream bytes to change between review and CI. The macOS smoke therefore
downloads each script, checks the URL, byte length, and SHA-256 against a
repository allowlist, and executes only on an exact match. A mismatch fails
before execution and requires a new source review plus an R-026 change-log
entry.

The installer job verifies only the expected path, executable bit, Mach-O
architecture, and `--version`. It does not run login, auth status, model list,
model inference, or update commands.

### 3. Google's installer documentation and bytes conflict

The formal Google page describes the scripts as install-or-upgrade paths and
advertises `--skip-aliases` and `--skip-path`. The reviewed shell, PowerShell,
and CMD scripts contain neither flag name; the reviewed shell script implements
only `-d`/`--dir` and help. The shell script also defers an existing install to
its background updater. The 2.6.2 guide must show the no-flag official command
and must not claim those documented-but-absent flags or `agy update` work.

### 4. Obsidian CLI supports a useful but bounded desktop smoke

Obsidian's official CLI exposes plugin enable/reload, DOM query, JavaScript
error, screenshot, and evaluation commands. The pinned 1.13.4 application
bundle also stores CLI enablement in its application configuration; the smoke
uses a disposable application profile and vault with `cli: true`, never a user
profile. This config-file preparation is release-binary evidence, not a
documented stable public setup API, so every pinned Obsidian upgrade must
revalidate it.

The smoke uses inert local fixture executables to reproduce
`not-installed -> login-required` without contacting an auth service. The
separate official-installer job never opens the settings screen, preventing an
automatic diagnosis from accidentally invoking auth or model discovery.
It also requires `osascript` and Terminal.app to exist, while unit tests assert
the exact AppleScript argv and escaping without triggering an Apple Event in a
headless runner. JavaScript errors are checked by comparing `dev:errors` with a
post-clear empty baseline rather than matching an incomplete list of error
strings.

The pinned 1.13.4 source initializes `settingsPopoutWindow` to `true`, and its
Settings modal's `shouldUsePopout()` method reads that vault option before
creating a second renderer. That code reassigns `activeWindow` and
`activeDocument`, but the CLI `eval` handler explicitly invokes `window.eval()`
and the screenshot handler captures the CLI host renderer. They therefore
remain scoped to the main renderer, so a main-document selector cannot observe
that popout. Both architecture artifacts reported `pluginLoaded: true`,
`settingsRoot: false`, `loadError: false`, zero cards/modals, and no captured
JavaScript errors in that main document. The fixture therefore writes only
`{"settingsPopoutWindow":false}` to the fresh vault's `app.json`. This is a
deterministic test-layout override, not a product preference change. The
harness proves the loaded setting is `false`, uses the registered
`app:open-settings` command once, requires its exact
`Executed: app:open-settings` result, proves the modal belongs to the main
document, waits for the plugin tab, and then calls
`openTabById("smart-composer")` once.

Run 31328304443 then verified those gates on both architectures. Its sanitized
failure structures agreed exactly on the relevant state:
`settingsPopoutConfigured: false`, `settingsPopoutOpen: false`,
`settingsDocumentIsMain: true`, `settingsTabRegistered: true`,
`settingsRoot: true`, `loadError: false`, and `cardCount: 2`. The command trace
continued through the Claude provider marker, two platform tabs, selected Mac
tab, platform labels, installation-check click, enabled login step, and
`claude-installer.png`. It stopped on the next document-global
`.modal-close-button` predicate. The failure screenshot was byte-identical to
the preceding Claude screenshot on each architecture, and no Gemini verifier
command appears in either trace. This narrows the failed assertion to harness
modal teardown; it is not evidence of a product transition failure or Gemini
success.

### 5. Release publication must fail closed

The tag workflow first runs the complete reusable CI. It then proves the tag
object is annotated and points to the exact new-branch head, validates all
version files, rebuilds the bundle, creates or updates only a draft release,
downloads the three assets, byte-compares them with the local build, and then
re-fetches the release branch immediately before publication to prove it still
equals the tagged commit. It then publishes. An existing public release,
unexpected draft asset, or concurrently moved branch causes failure instead of
being overwritten or published with a stale qualification.

## Inferences Requiring Validation

1. A GitHub-hosted macOS Aqua session will launch the pinned Obsidian Electron
   app and expose its CLI socket. Run both matrix jobs to validate this.
2. Pre-seeding `cli: true` remains accepted by Obsidian 1.13.4 on both runner
   architectures. Confirm through `obsidian version` and plugin commands.
3. The community plugin loads from the disposable vault without an interactive
   restricted-mode dialog. Confirm the Plan cards appear and no settings-load
   error is captured.
4. DOM hooks and fake executables reliably drive the installation-check to
   login-step transition. Confirm the two provider screenshots and DOM summary.
5. The official runtime installers may change at any time. If a hash mismatch
   occurs, download and inspect the new source; never update only the digest.

## Decision And Implementation Contract

- CI triggers on `codex/**` pushes, every PR, optional manual
  `workflow_dispatch`, and reusable `workflow_call`. Release qualification does
  not depend on dispatch because a workflow that exists only on an unmerged
  branch may not receive a `workflow_dispatch` event until it is present on the
  default branch.
- All jobs use Node.js 20 and workflow-level `contents: read`; only the tag
  release workflow receives `contents: write`.
- Ubuntu runs type, lint, all tests, production build, and bundle budget.
- Windows 2025 and both macOS architectures run all tests and build.
- Separate dual-architecture jobs cover reviewed official installers and the
  pinned Obsidian fixture smoke.
- The disposable vault fixes only `settingsPopoutWindow: false` in its
  `.obsidian/app.json` before launch, keeping Settings in the main renderer
  observed by CLI `eval`, its global `document`, DOM queries, and
  `dev:screenshot`.
- The desktop smoke opens Settings once through the registered
  `app:open-settings` command, gates on a main-document Settings modal, then
  gates on Smart Composer tab registration before selecting that tab once.
  It finally requires either the plugin settings root or its explicit load-error
  root, and fails immediately on the latter. Polling must not repeatedly reopen
  Settings or reselect the tab.
- Provider modal teardown must start at that provider's
  `[data-runtime-installer]` marker, resolve its nearest `.modal-container`,
  click only the contained `.modal-bg`, and wait for the same provider marker
  to disappear. A document-global `.modal-close-button` must not be used while
  the Obsidian Settings modal and a provider modal coexist.
- Screenshots and diagnostic summaries contain only a fresh empty vault and
  fake unauthenticated runtimes. They are retained for 14 days.
- The Draft PR remains unmerged. The repository default branch is unchanged.
- Stable publication is permitted only after two consecutive successful
  dual-architecture qualifications of the same push run. After the branch push
  succeeds, rerun that exact run with `gh run rerun <run-id>` so GitHub records
  `run_attempt: 2` without changing the SHA. The release preflight requires
  exactly two attempts, fetches the attempt-1 and attempt-2 API records, proves
  both are successful push attempts for the tagged SHA, prints both attempt
  URLs, and then runs the complete reusable CI again before creating a draft.
- The release tag is annotated `2.6.2` and must equal the new branch head.
- The branch/tag equality check is repeated immediately before changing the
  verified draft to stable/latest.
- The release contains exactly `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`.

## Expected Change Surface

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/runtime-smoke-allowlist.json`
- `.github/scripts/*-macos.sh` and the pinned-artifact verifier
- this report, R-025's explicit corrections, and the research register

## Test And Release Gates

### Local/static gates

- Parse both workflow files as YAML.
- Run an Actions-aware static validator.
- Parse the allowlist and verify all required IDs and lowercase SHA-256 values.
- Shell syntax-check both macOS scripts.
- Exercise the artifact verifier with a known mismatch and an exact local copy.

### Remote gates

- Ubuntu, Windows 2025, macOS arm64, and macOS Intel jobs all succeed.
- Both official installer jobs resolve expected native paths and architectures.
- Both Obsidian jobs create two provider screenshots and a sanitized summary.
- No auth, model, update, account, Keychain, or private-vault data appears in
  logs or artifacts.
- The complete macOS workflow succeeds twice consecutively before tagging.
- Draft release asset names, sizes, and SHA-256 values match the tag build.
- Preserve pre-publication evidence below. The tag workflow appends final run,
  tag, and asset provenance to the immutable GitHub Release notes before it
  publishes. This avoids moving the release branch after the required
  `tag commit == branch HEAD` check merely to add a self-referential run URL.

## Known Unknowns And Deferred Decisions

1. GitHub Actions cannot verify how a beginner perceives the modal or terminal.
2. Browser OAuth, Apple Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, and account-plan
   provenance remain deliberately untested without a user-owned machine.
3. A future Obsidian release may change the application config or CLI socket;
   keep 1.13.4 pinned until a new version is separately reviewed.
4. Upstream installer hash drift is expected and is a review event, not a
   reason to weaken or bypass the check.
5. No branch-protection rule currently enforces these jobs outside the release
   workflow. The release workflow's reusable-CI dependency is therefore the
   publication enforcement mechanism for 2.6.2.

## Security And Privacy

No credentials, tokens, OAuth codes, account identifiers, Keychain records,
private vault content, model prompts, or model responses were recorded. The
desktop smoke creates a disposable empty vault and uses inert fake executables.
The official installer smoke runs only `--version` after installation. Workflow
logs and uploaded artifacts must remain secret-free.

## Change Log

- 2026-08-10: Initial repository/API, runner, first-party-document, installer
  hash, Obsidian release, CI, and release-pipeline investigation. Remote run and
  publication evidence remains pending.
- 2026-08-10: Recorded Draft PR #1 and superseded run 31325631944. That run
  proved Windows and both macOS source jobs, then failed closed before desktop
  matrices when an Ubuntu-hosted UI test omitted its intended Windows platform.
  Final immutable provenance is assigned to generated Release notes so the
  tagged branch is never moved by a post-publication documentation commit.
- 2026-08-10: Recorded superseded run 31326265208. It proved every source gate,
  both official installers, the pinned Obsidian bytes/signature/architectures,
  CLI socket, plugin reload, and JavaScript eval. Both desktop jobs then failed
  closed because the harness did not accept `=> true` and did not wait for CLI
  command registration across the restricted-mode reload. Added centralized
  boolean parsing, documented-command readiness waits, plugin-load wait, and a
  sanitized startup summary/screenshot for future failure evidence.
- 2026-08-10: Recorded superseded run 31327311829. It proved the readiness and
  boolean fixes on both architectures, but pinned 1.13.4 source and the
  sanitized artifacts showed Settings opening in its default popout renderer
  while the CLI inspected the main document. Pinned the disposable vault to an
  in-window Settings modal and separated command open, modal readiness,
  plugin-tab registration, one-shot tab selection, and render assertions.
- 2026-08-10: Recorded superseded run 31328304443 and both sanitized artifact
  digests. It proved the main-window Settings root, two Plan cards, Claude OS
  tabs, and installation-check-to-Step-4 transition on both architectures. The
  jobs then exposed an unscoped modal-close harness predicate before Gemini;
  modal teardown is now anchored to the active provider's own backdrop.
