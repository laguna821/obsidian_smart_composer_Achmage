# Smart Composer Custom Research Register

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This register is a mandatory planning input. Before creating a large combined
> update plan, read every report marked **Verified** and **Mandatory** below.

The repository-root `AGENTS.md` also requires Codex to open this register before
any non-trivial implementation work and to read the reports relevant to the
affected feature. For Plan runtime onboarding work, R-023 through R-025 are an
explicit mandatory set. R-026 is additionally mandatory when qualifying or
publishing the 2.6.2 release. R-027 is mandatory for Claude Plan authentication
classification and the 2.6.3 Pro/Max hotfix or release.

## Purpose

The custom Smart Composer roadmap will be assembled only after several features
and external plugins have been investigated across separate sessions. This
register prevents verified context from being replaced by memory, guesses, or
premature synthesis.

## Status Definitions

- **Verified**: Source inspection and/or a live test has produced reproducible
  findings.
- **Planned**: The topic is known, but no findings may be assumed yet.
- **Superseded**: A newer report replaces the older report.
- **Mandatory**: The report must be read before broad planning or implementation.
- **Partially verified**: Source or official-document evidence exists, but a
  required live environment or clean-machine reproduction is still pending.

## Mandatory Synthesis Rule

Do not create the final large-scale roadmap until the user explicitly asks for
the synthesis. At that point:

1. Re-open this register.
2. Read all reports currently marked **Verified** and **Mandatory**.
3. Separate verified behavior from architectural proposals.
4. Resolve contradictions between reports explicitly.
5. Preserve untested questions as validation tasks instead of silently assuming
   answers.

## Adding Future Reports

Use the next unused zero-padded ID and keep the established descriptive naming
form: `R-###-topic-slug.md`. Start from
[`REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`](REPORT_TEMPLATE.md). A materially different question
gets a new report; an older verified report is never silently repurposed or
renumbered.

Update this register in the same change that adds the report. If new evidence
contradicts an older report, identify the exact superseded claim in both the new
row/report and the older report instead of deleting history.

Each investigation should produce one report with:

- exact plugin/repository version and commit where possible;
- source paths inspected;
- live tests performed and their sanitized results;
- observed failures and boundary conditions;
- UX and architecture implications;
- known unknowns and deferred decisions;
- artifacts or reproducible examples;
- an explicit statement that no secrets were recorded.
